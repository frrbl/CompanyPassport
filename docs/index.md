# Project description

Company Passport is a trust framework that is evolved from an NL based innovation
project with the Dutch Chamber of Commerce, Dutch Tax Office, ABN AMRO bank,
the Royal Dutch Association of Civil-law Notaries (KNB) and the Dutch Blockchain
Coalition.
The trust framework is intended to facilitate use cases that require validated data
related to legal entities. It uses SSI (Self Sovereign Identity) technologies and should
align with the upcoming eIDAS 2 regulations. It is not a software solution but
describes how compliant software solutions interact. These software solutions can
be provided by any public or private third party.
The initial focus will address NL based use cases. However, the objective is to
assume a cross border, international context that could address all kind of different
uses cases across country borders and different domains. Company Passport work
may provide valuable input to other trust frameworks and initiatives related to
organizational digital identity. For instance the eIDAS/EUDI Wallet LSP’s, EBSI,
Gaia-X, ESG reporting (Environmental, Social, Governance), EU DPP (Digital
Product Passports), ESPR (Ecodesign for Sustainable Products Regulation), CSRD
(Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive) etc
As part of the overall Company Passport trust framework, the architectural and
technical specifications need to be agreed upon and described. This work is carried
out by the Company Passport Architecture Working Group and documented oh this documentation
site.

# Use case

As the initial use case the Architecture WG will focus on the use case of founding a
new “Besloten Vennootschap” (BV), a Dutch private limited liability company (Ltd.).
This use case acts as an example of a process that involves the exchange of
company data between a range of stakeholders, the company and its founders and
employees. However, the objective is to provide a generic trust framework and
architecture that can also be applied to other use cases and with different credentials
and stakeholders. During the course of the project additional example use cases
may be added.

## Example interactions

1. **Notary Verification & Incorporation Deed**:
   Company representatives present statutes to a notary, who verifies stakeholder identities and statutes legality, then
   **issues the deed of incorporation**, formalizing company establishment.

2. **Chamber of Commerce Registration**:
   The company submits incorporation documents to the Chamber of Commerce (KVK), which verifies and approves these
   documents, issuing a company registration number and formally registering the company.

3. **Tax Registration**:
   The company applies for tax identification and VAT registration with the Tax Authority (Belastingdienst), which
   verifies the company's legal status and tax eligibility to ensure national tax regulation compliance.

4. **Bank Account Opening**:
   The company approaches a bank to open a business account, necessary for financial transactions. The bank conducts KYC
   and AML checks to ensure financial regulation compliance before account creation.

# Glossary

## Company passport

Trust framework (“Afsprakenstelsel”) to facilitate the exchange of verifiable
data about legal entities. [More info](https://dutchblockchaincoalition.org/en/use-cases-2/ondernemingspaspoort-1).

## Organizational wallet

Software component, acting on behalf of an organization (any legal entity),
capable of receiving and storing verifiable credentials (VCs), issuing
(generating) VCs, verifying VCs and presenting verifiable presentations (VPs)
based on those VCs. Most often a web based application that can be used
multiple persons within an organization. But may also be a mobile
(iOS/Android) app.

## Personal wallet(s)

Software component, acting on behalf of a natural person, capable of
receiving and storing verifiable credentials (VCs), issuing (generating) self-
issued VCs, verifying VCs and presenting verifiable presentations (VPs)
based on those VCs. Most often a mobile (iOS/Android) app but may also be
a web based application.

## Process Guidance System

In previous phases of the Company Passport project the term “Process
Guidance System” (PGS) has often been used. It refers to a web application
or mobile app that guides people through particular processes. For instance,
the founding of a company. During the process PGS application interacts with
organizational and/or personal wallets to request or exchange verifiable
credentials. From an architectural perspective a PGS application is
considered as any relying party system that is requesting the presentation of
particular verifiable credentials. In case a verifiable credential is not yet
available the PGS can redirect to issuers of the verifiable credential.
